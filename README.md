[![irc.libera.chat #secp256k1](https://img.shields.io/badge/irc.libera.chat-%23secp256k1-success)](https://web.libera.chat/#secp256k1)

High-performance high-assurance C library for digital signatures and other cryptographic primitives on the secp256k1 elliptic curve.

This library is intended to be the highest quality publicly available library for cryptography on the secp256k1 curve. However, the primary focus of its development has been for usage in the Bitcoin system and usage unlike Bitcoin's may be less well tested, verified, or suffer from a less well thought out interface. Correct usage requires some care and consideration that the library is fit for your application's purpose.

Features:
* secp256k1 ECDSA signing/verification and key generation.
* Additive and multiplicative tweaking of secret/public keys.
* Serialization/parsing of secret keys, public keys, signatures.
* Constant time, constant memory access signing and public key generation.
* Derandomized ECDSA (via RFC6979 or with a caller provided function.)
* Very efficient implementation.
* Suitable for embedded systems.
* No runtime dependencies.
* Optional module for public key recovery.
* Optional module for ECDH key exchange.
* Optional module for Schnorr signatures according to [BIP-340](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki).
* Optional module for ElligatorSwift key exchange according to [BIP-324](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0324.mediawiki).
* Optional module for MuSig2 Schnorr multi-signatures according to [BIP-327](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0327.mediawiki).
* Optional module for Silent Payments sending and receiving according to [BIP-352](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0352.mediawiki).

Implementation details
----------------------

* General
  * No runtime heap allocation.
  * Extensive testing infrastructure.
  * Structured to facilitate review and analysis.
  * Intended to be portable to any system with a C89 compiler and uint64_t support.
  * No use of floating types.
  * Expose only higher level interfaces to minimize the API surface and improve application security. ("Be difficult to use insecurely.")
* Field operations
  * Optimized implementation of arithmetic modulo the curve's field size (2^256 - 0x1000003D1).
    * Using 5 52-bit limbs
    * Using 10 26-bit limbs (including hand-optimized assembly for 32-bit ARM, by Wladimir J. van der Laan).
      * This is an experimental feature that has not received enough scrutiny to satisfy the standard of quality of this library but is made available for testing and review by the community.
* Scalar operations
  * Optimized implementation without data-dependent branches of arithmetic modulo the curve's order.
    * Using 4 64-bit limbs (relying on __int128 support in the compiler).
    * Using 8 32-bit limbs.
* Modular inverses (both field elements and scalars) based on [safegcd](https://gcd.cr.yp.to/index.html) with some modifications, and a variable-time variant (by Peter Dettman).
* Group operations
  * Point addition formula specifically simplified for the curve equation (y^2 = x^3 + 7).
  * Use addition between points in Jacobian and affine coordinates where possible.
  * Use a unified addition/doubling formula where necessary to avoid data-dependent branches.
  * Point/x comparison without a field inversion by comparison in the Jacobian coordinate space.
* Point multiplication for verification (a*P + b*G).
  * Use wNAF notation for point multiplicands.
  * Use a much larger window for multiples of G, using precomputed multiples.
  * Use Shamir's trick to do the multiplication with the public key and the generator simultaneously.
  * Use secp256k1's efficiently-computable endomorphism to split the P multiplicand into 2 half-sized ones.
* Point multiplication for signing
  * Use a precomputed table of multiples of powers of 16 multiplied with the generator, so general multiplication becomes a series of additions.
  * Intended to be completely free of timing sidechannels for secret-key operations (on reasonable hardware/toolchains)
    * Access the table with branch-free conditional moves so memory access is uniform.
    * No data-dependent branches
  * Optional runtime blinding which attempts to frustrate differential power analysis.
  * The precomputed tables add and eventually subtract points for which no known scalar (secret key) is known, preventing even an attacker with control over the secret key used to control the data internally.

Obtaining and verifying
-----------------------

The git tag for each release (e.g. `v0.6.0`) is GPG-signed by one of the maintainers.
For a fully verified build of this project, it is recommended to obtain this repository
via git, obtain the GPG keys of the signing maintainer(s), and then verify the release
tag's signature using git.

This can be done with the following steps:

1. Obtain the GPG keys listed in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).
2. If possible, cross-reference these key IDs with another source controlled by its owner (e.g.
   social media, personal website). This is to mitigate the unlikely case that incorrect 
   content is being presented by this repository.
3. Clone the repository: 
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1
    ```
4. Check out the latest release tag, e.g. 
    ```
    git checkout v0.7.1
    ```
5. Use git to verify the GPG signature: 
   ```
   % git tag -v v0.7.1 | grep -C 3 'Good signature'

   gpg: Signature made Mon 26 Jan 2026 07:42:46 PM UTC
   gpg:                using RSA key 2840EAABF4BC9F0FFD716AFAFBAFCC46DE2D3FE2
   gpg: Good signature from "Pieter Wuille <pieter@wuille.net>" [unknown]
   gpg:                 aka "Pieter Wuille <pieter.wuille@gmail.com>" [full]
   gpg:                 aka "[jpeg image of size 5996]" [undefined]
   gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
   gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
   Primary key fingerprint: 133E AC17 9436 F14A 5CF1  B794 860F EB80 4E66 9320
        Subkey fingerprint: 2840 EAAB F4BC 9F0F FD71  6AFA FBAF CC46 DE2D 3FE2
   ```

Building with Autotools
-----------------------

    $ ./autogen.sh       # Generate a ./configure script
    $ ./configure        # Generate a build system
    $ make               # Run the actual build process
    $ make check         # Run the test suite
    $ sudo make install  # Install the library into the system (optional)

To compile optional modules (such as Schnorr signatures), you need to run `./configure` with additional flags (such as `--enable-module-schnorrsig`). Run `./configure --help` to see the full list of available flags.

Building with CMake
-------------------

To maintain a pristine source tree, CMake encourages to perform an out-of-source build by using a separate dedicated build tree.

### Building on POSIX systems

    $ cmake -B build              # Generate a build system in subdirectory "build"
    $ cmake --build build         # Run the actual build process
    $ ctest --test-dir build      # Run the test suite
    $ sudo cmake --install build  # Install the library into the system (optional)

To compile optional modules (such as Schnorr signatures), you need to run `cmake` with additional flags (such as `-DSECP256K1_ENABLE_MODULE_SCHNORRSIG=ON`). Run `cmake -B build -LH` or `ccmake -B build` to see the full list of available flags.

### Cross compiling

To alleviate issues with cross compiling, preconfigured toolchain files are available in the `cmake` directory.
For example, to cross compile for Windows:

    $ cmake -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/x86_64-w64-mingw32.toolchain.cmake

To cross compile for Android with [NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/cmake) (using NDK's toolchain file, and assuming the `ANDROID_NDK_ROOT` environment variable has been set):

    $ cmake -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="${ANDROID_NDK_ROOT}/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake" -DANDROID_ABI=arm64-v8a -DANDROID_PLATFORM=28

### Building on Windows

The following example assumes Visual Studio 2022. Using clang-cl is recommended.

In "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022":

    >cmake -B build -T ClangCL
    >cmake --build build --config RelWithDebInfo

Usage examples
-----------
Usage examples can be found in the [examples](examples) directory. To compile them you need to configure with `--enable-examples`.
  * [ECDSA example](examples/ecdsa.c)
  * [Schnorr signatures example](examples/schnorr.c)
  * [Deriving a shared secret (ECDH) example](examples/ecdh.c)
  * [ElligatorSwift key exchange example](examples/ellswift.c)
  * [MuSig2 Schnorr multi-signatures example](examples/musig.c)
  * [Silent Payments send and receive example](examples/silentpayments.c)

To compile the examples, make sure the corresponding modules are enabled.

Benchmark
------------
If configured with `--enable-benchmark` (which is the default), binaries for benchmarking the libsecp256k1 functions will be present in the root directory after the build.

To print the benchmark result to the command line:

    $ ./bench_name

To create a CSV file for the benchmark result :

    $ ./bench_name | sed '2d;s/ \{1,\}//g' > bench_name.csv

Fuzz-oracle audit: package test-accept state preservation
----------------------------------------------------------

This audit record covers Bitcoin Core's `ephemeral_package_eval` and `tx_package_eval` fuzz targets. The Core base was `origin/master` at `18c05d93016b28a9afd4c716dfe00b6e0accb30b0`; the audit branch also contains unrelated commit `1df24a61f7` in `validation.cpp`, outside the tested hunk. `origin/master` and `remotes/l0rinc/master` both resolve to that same commit, and `git log origin/master..remotes/l0rinc/master -- src/test/fuzz/package_eval.cpp src/validation.cpp src/txmempool.cpp` was empty, so no relevant l0rinc commit was cherry-picked.

The new oracle snapshots the complete externally relevant mempool state around every `test_accept` boundary: txid/wtxid and entry metadata, fee-prioritisation deltas, unbroadcast membership, total size and fee, sequence, transaction-update counter, and load-attempt state. Single-transaction package test accepts are checked before/after `ProcessNewPackage`; multi-transaction submissions are checked before/after the final `AcceptToMemoryPool(test_accept=true)` evaluation. Existing result-map, fee, replacement, TRUC, and ephemeral invariants remain in force.

Severity and Core reachability: clean master reproduced no production failure. This is Low/informational oracle hardening, not a confirmed production bug, and not consensus validation, invalid-block handling, peer-triggerable block acceptance, memory safety, or Critical severity. Core's local `testmempoolaccept` and package-evaluation RPC paths use `test_accept=true` (`src/rpc/mempool.cpp`); peer package submission in `src/net_processing.cpp` uses `test_accept=false`. If the modeled regression existed, it could mutate local policy-evaluation state, but the clean production contract is intact. No deterministic regression test was added because no clean-master bug was confirmed; the exact production mutation below is the regression proof for the oracle.

Fuzz-oracle audit: external block-file import index contracts
---------------------------------------------------------------

Source commit `d5a7b999c4` strengthens Bitcoin Core's
`FUZZ=load_external_block_file`. The audit base is `origin/master`
`18c05d93016b28a9afd4c716dfe00b6e0accb30b0`; this branch also contains
unrelated audit commit `1df24a61f7` in `validation.cpp`, outside the tested
`LoadExternalBlockFile` hunk. The target calls
`ChainstateManager::LoadExternalBlockFile` (`src/validation.cpp:4983-5150`),
which Core reaches from `src/node/blockstorage.cpp:1276-1329` for `-reindex`
and `-loadblock=`. Its input is local external block-file/reindex data, not a
direct peer message. Clean master produced no production failure, so this is
informational/Low oracle hardening, not a confirmed bug or Critical invalid-
block vulnerability.

The harness snapshots each existing `CBlockIndex` identity, parent pointer,
height, chain work, version, block hash, merkle root, time, bits, and nonce
before import. It then requires old entries to remain at the same addresses
with unchanged identity/ancestry, every map key to match `GetBlockHash()`,
every parent pointer to resolve to the same indexed object, contiguous
parent/child heights, nondecreasing chain work, and an indexed active tip.
Legitimate storage/status updates and new entries remain allowed. The old
47-line target discarded the operation result and checked none of these
contracts.

l0rinc review and masking record: `origin/master` and
`remotes/l0rinc/master` both resolve to `18c05d93016b28a9afd4c716dfe00b6e0accb30b0`;
`git log origin/master..remotes/l0rinc/master -- src/test/fuzz/load_external_block_file.cpp src/validation.cpp src/node/blockstorage.cpp`
was empty. No relevant l0rinc commit was cherry-picked. No later fix or
cherry-pick was used to mask this clean-master result. Any later change must
state whether it preserves, changes, or masks this behavior and amend the
relevant commit and ledger with the exact evidence.

Mutation sensitivity proof, not a clean-master production finding:

* Immediately after a successful `AcceptBlock` in `LoadExternalBlockFile`, add `m_blockman.LookupBlockIndex(hash)->nHeight++`. Mutated production `src/validation.cpp` SHA-256: `f5408af31fc728c364c61ade6fcf9114aa4f5ef82c4a3e9a64f7108c2f2054c9`; mutated fuzzer binary SHA-256: `82680aff8f379198c9d67ac58eb7e2dcba0eb9d5cfc202584dcdce64488e2665`.
* Witness: `/tmp/bitcoin-load-external-block-file-20260720/python-block1-late-fuzz-seed.dat`, 164 bytes, SHA-256 `3252e3f6dfae7b61e4ba5bac39d444b385b8376c6f3d153035f8ea615deb6c39`:

* The mutated run produced an assertion/libFuzzer deadly-signal abort after one input at `src/test/fuzz/load_external_block_file.cpp:89`, `index.nHeight == index.pprev->nHeight + 1`; the stack reached `AssertBlockIndexImportContracts`, the target at line 127, `test_one_input`, and `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`. Mutation log SHA-256: `b4413d9c945b13f3109e60b42bf6daeca495beff0470514dca1bf65b2b8f19e3`. No artifact was emitted because the oracle uses an assertion abort.
* Restoring production made the same witness pass. This is proof that the oracle detects the modeled regression, not proof of a clean-master defect. No deterministic production regression test was added because no clean-master bug was confirmed.

Severity ledger reiterated: private-broadcast failed-send retention is Medium
and feature-conditional; empty HEADERS initial-sync handoff is Medium
availability/IBD; peer transaction activity refresh is Low; process-message
block-storage failure handling is Low/local-write dependent; oversized
transport types are Low with current Core callers; ecmult scratch wrapping,
forced 10x26 magnitude-32 normalization, and SHA/HMAC/RFC6979 retention are
Medium latent or hygiene findings with limited reachability; banman invalid
subnet/unban integrity is Low/nice-to-have. The txdownloadman/txrequest,
connman, eviction, handshake, compact-block, headers-sync, coins-view, UTXO
snapshot, mempool-persistence, and package test-accept campaigns found no
additional clean-master production bug in their audited paths. Severity is
master- and Core-caller-relative: invalid fuzzer state or an invalid block
alone is not Critical, and a nonce with no cryptographic meaning is not
critical merely because it is not cleared.

Verifiers were `clang-format --dry-run --Werror`, `git diff --check`,
`cmake --build /tmp/bitcoin-secp256k1-audit-current-build --target fuzz -j2`,
the clean replay, the exact witness replay, the documented production
mutation replay, and the four-worker command above. No fuzz process or
artifact remains.

this commit. The l0rinc query
`git log origin/master..remotes/l0rinc/master -- src/test/fuzz/addrman.cpp src/addrman.cpp src/addrdb.cpp src/net_processing.cpp`
was empty, so there was no relevant commit to cherry-pick and no later fix was
used to mask this result.

Core caller and severity boundary:

* `src/net_processing.cpp:5820-5878` receives peer `ADDR`/`ADDRV2` records,
  filters them, and calls `AddrMan::Add`; `Good` and `SetServices` are reached
  from connection handling at lines 3885 and 3702. `src/addrdb.cpp:196-225`
  loads and serializes the local `peers.dat` state. These are address-gossip,
  peer-selection, and local-persistence paths, not consensus or block
  validation paths.
* No clean-master production bug was confirmed. The result is Low/informational
  oracle hardening. Invalid fuzzer state or an invalid block alone is not
  High/Critical, and a nonce with no cryptographic meaning is not Critical
  merely because it is not cleared. Any future failure must be rated from the
  actual Core caller, input origin, and master behavior.

Oracle contracts:

* `GetEntries` output must agree with new/tried flags, bucket and position
  bounds, reference multiplicity, unique address identity, `Size`, and the
  existing production `CheckAddrman` invariant where the state is at most
  4,096 entries.
* `GetAddr` results must be valid and unique, exactly match the expected set for
  small states, and be bounded, filtered, and drawn from the expected state for
  large states. The oracle deliberately uses `GetNetClass` for `GetAddr` and
  `GetNetwork` for `Size`/`Select`, matching their separate production
  contracts.
* `Select` must return an address from the requested table/network whenever
  one exists, or an invalid address otherwise. `Good`, `Attempt`, `Connected`,
  and `SetServices` have operation-local before/after assertions. Successful
  deserialization and serialize/deserialize round trips receive the same
  state checks.
* The full table oracle is scheduled at every 64 operations for ordinary
  states and every 1,024 operations for large states. Large `GetAddr` checks
  use a 256-result cap and skip scans for network classes absent from a large
  table; operation-local assertions remain on every transition. This bounds
  harness amplification without weakening the exact small-state contracts.

  The complete 1,793-input final oracle replay was not used as a pass claim:
  large inputs entered multi-minute production `AddrMan::Add` callbacks that
  libFuzzer could not interrupt with `-timeout=60`. Those attempts were
  terminated and classified as corpus execution cost, not findings; the
  bounded subset and full serialization corpus are the completed final proof.

Mutation sensitivity proof, not a clean-master production finding:

  This proves oracle sensitivity to a modeled replacement regression, not a
  master defect, so no production fix or deterministic regression test is
  claimed.

Rejected oracle and correction record:

The first `GetAddr` filter assertion incorrectly used `GetNetwork` instead of
the production method's `GetNetClass`. It failed on exact artifact
`oracle-artifacts/crash-935ea9dc5c38a59f222ab627166b12a6e44b6e77`, SHA-256
`076682611cdda4d348cdbdd76395a48f1c185ee29bced7a3fd1f851e111161f0`, with

The stale log SHA-256 is
`6f26d1368ab4bd6b4aa602f3a0671da3fdc61d6f078467bea696ae4734c439f6`;
after changing only the oracle to `GetNetClass`, the exact artifact passed,
with corrected replay log SHA-256
`910863c7b1f02c508aa87abdc756d212a27959226a96b2b96c66ee05f41513a6`.
This was a stale/overbroad harness oracle, not a production finding.

Existing finding ledger is reiterated against unmodified master and actual
Bitcoin Core reachability: private-broadcast failed-send retention is Medium
and feature-conditional; empty HEADERS initial-sync handoff is Medium
availability/IBD; peer transaction activity refresh and process-message
storage failure are Low; oversized transport types are Low in current Core
callers; ecmult scratch wrapping, forced 10x26 magnitude-32 normalization,
and SHA/HMAC/RFC6979 retention are Medium latent or hygiene findings with
limited demonstrated reachability; banman invalid-subnet integrity is
Low/nice-to-have. The txdownloadman/txrequest, connman, eviction, handshake,
compact-block, headers-sync, coins-view, UTXO snapshot, mempool-persistence,
and package test-accept campaigns found no additional clean-master production
bug. Severity is master- and Core-caller-relative: invalid fuzzer state or an
invalid block alone is not Critical, and a nonce with no cryptographic meaning
is not Critical merely because it is not cleared.

Verifiers: `clang-format --dry-run --Werror` on the changed harness files,
`git diff --check`, `cmake --build /tmp/bitcoin-secp256k1-audit-current-build
--target fuzz -j2`, the bounded addrman replay, the full addrman_serdeser
replay, the data-stream replay, the exact mutation replay, and both four-worker
commands above. Production was restored to its clean hash and no fuzz process
or generated artifact remains in either source worktree.

## Coins-cache transition oracle audit (2026-07-20)

Scope and source state:

* Base is exact master `18c05d93016b28a9afd4c716dfe00b6e0accb30b` on the
  audit branch. Target is `FUZZ=coinscache_sim`; production behavior is
  unchanged. The harness now calls the existing `CCoinsViewCache::SanityCheck`
  after every simulated command, so dirty/fresh flags, the circular dirty
  list, dirty-count accounting, and cached dynamic-memory accounting are
  checked before a later reset, flush, or overwrite can repair an intermediate
  defect. No duplicate best-block model was added because the coins-view and
  stacked-view targets already cover best-block propagation.
* Original harness SHA-256 was
  `05a151e9bb8edb8a0b7aea6ab662de578684e0bfddb1efa578506c5dd89330ca`;
  final harness SHA-256 is
  `25d608c872df9bf66f16fe96a41de69b588119c5661e71c66c82bb06875dad49`.
  Unchanged production `src/coins.cpp` SHA-256 is
  `2c7ca3aab136509449d4810b5174f21ad8bbf6853d175a69d601fe7697c25096`.
  The final ASan/UBSan/fuzzer binary SHA-256 is
  `d18113d2809f067f61138f93da76329cb83ed3f54930d8c962519b7cbe069c08`.

Corpus and clean verification:

* Frozen corpus is `/tmp/bitcoin-coinscache-20260720/frozen`, copied from
  `/mnt/my_storage/qa-assets/fuzz_corpora/coinscache_sim`: 305 files and
  5,153,077 bytes. Sorted file-entry manifest SHA-256 is
  `a8d126f8bfd18f1344561cc79347ee394a6094dff0aaeecf620b635a91bcc44c`.
* The original execution-only baseline completed 309 executions, coverage
  2021, features 13192, peak RSS 214 MiB, exit 0, with no artifacts. The
  final clean replay completed 307 executions, coverage 2027, features 13223,
  peak RSS 213 MiB, exit 0, with no artifacts; final log SHA-256 is
  `c6b99abff0492f76526edac19c16e97da8c204402741b4ee80de34ccca9cebfd`.
* Four independent sanitizer workers loaded the same 305-file corpus and
  completed 307, 307, 308, and 310 executions. Each exited 0 with coverage
  2027, peak RSS 214 MiB, and no sanitizer, assertion, timeout, OOM, or
  artifact diagnostic. Parent log SHA-256 is
  `91bd43feac067a11deb41601490ff2311d9d599c68f187dde712109800894bc9`.

Differential oracle proof, not a master production finding:

* A disposable production mutation removed the single `++m_dirty_count` in
  `CCoinsViewCache::AddCoin` immediately after `SetDirty`. This models a
  broken publication of a cache state that `BatchWrite` and `Flush` rely on.
  Mutated production source SHA-256 was
  `bad0f00f95371389bc6872725eb281cf77c430c15aa725300d73ded3f11d28f4` and
  the enhanced mutated binary SHA-256 was
  `7e3e83450368f6cc2a39b94143b221503f1f36a7b4db8216526ce4403c56315d`.
* The exact proof input is four bytes `0d 00 00 05`, SHA-256
  `cd318afe91129a721a28f401677a18e89f37e314718d9b03eb22a73b29f24244`,
  Base64 `DQAABQ==`. Its reverse-consumed commands add a coin, then reset the
  cache. Enhanced replay with `-handle_abrt=0` exits 134 at
  `src/coins.cpp:365`, assertion
  `count_dirty == count_linked && count_dirty == m_dirty_count`; log SHA-256
  is `18fbdd06b54b6f22eb4bf3748eb57b1220b657e59b2d4b9a94638298a419eb75`.
* The same mutated production code with the teardown-only harness, with the
  per-transition checker invocation removed, accepts the exact input in exit
  0 and 1 ms; log SHA-256 is
  `5c775bfafa1a021c8f4ff1bb9396c54dd4739aa972f4d6dc0b553f2ab1292f39`.
  This is the needed counterfactual: reset erases the damaged state before
  the old final checker runs. The production mutation was restored, the clean
  binary accepts the same input, and no deterministic regression test is
  claimed because master did not fail.

Bitcoin Core reachability and severity:

* `CCoinsViewCache` is the UTXO cache used by chainstate block connection and
  rollback. `AddCoin`, `BatchWrite`, and `Flush` participate in `UpdateCoins`,
  `Chainstate::ConnectTip`, and periodic state flushes. `Uncache` is also
  reached from mempool trimming and failed transaction/package cleanup. The
  proof input directly exercises the cache API, not a serialized block or a
  peer message, so it does not prove that an invalid block triggers anything
  on master.
* Clean master has no production failure, so this campaign reports no new
  bug, severity, or production fix. If the modeled missing dirty-count update
  existed in production, a Core-reachable cache accounting failure could be a
  high-severity node-availability or UTXO-state-integrity problem; that is
  mutation impact context, not a vulnerability claim against master. Invalid
  fuzzer state alone is not Critical, and a nonce with no cryptographic
  meaning is not Critical merely because it is uncleared.

Cherry-pick context and reiterated findings:

* No l0rinc fork commit applies specifically to this oracle, so no cherry-pick
  was made. This commit is oracle-only and preserves master behavior. Any later
  production fix, minor fix, oracle change, or cherry-pick must retain the
  exact corpus/input, mutation, assertion, stack/status, Core caller and input
  origin, test gap, severity, and verifier commands, and must say whether it
  preserves, changes, or masks this clean-master behavior.
* Existing findings remain master- and Core-caller-relative: private-broadcast
  failed-send retention is Medium and feature-conditional; empty HEADERS IBD
  handoff is Medium availability; peer activity refresh, process-message local
  storage failure, and oversized transport types are Low in current callers;
  ecmult scratch wrapping, forced 10x26 normalization, and SHA/HMAC/RFC6979
  retention are Medium latent or hygiene findings with limited reachability;
  banman invalid-subnet integrity is Low/nice-to-have. Earlier
  txdownloadman, txrequest, connman, eviction, handshake, compact-block,
  headers-sync, coins-view, UTXO snapshot, mempool-persistence, package
  test-accept, and addrman campaigns found no additional clean-master
  production bug.

Verifiers: `git diff --check`; `ninja -C
/tmp/bitcoin-secp256k1-audit-current-build bin/fuzz`; the final 305-file
replay; the exact proof replay; and the four-worker command
`FUZZ=coinscache_sim /tmp/bitcoin-secp256k1-audit-current-build/bin/fuzz
/mnt/my_storage/qa-assets/fuzz_corpora/coinscache_sim -runs=1 -jobs=4
-workers=4`. No fuzz process remains.
