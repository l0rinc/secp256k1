# secp256k1 Fuzz Oracles

Current upstream `master` did not contain tracked fuzz targets or seed corpora
before this directory was added. These targets are intentionally small public-API
oracles that exercise contract boundaries rather than only maximizing coverage.

Targets:

- `fuzz_api_roundtrip`: pubkey, ECDSA compact, DER, private-key DER, signing, verification, normalization
- `fuzz_context`: context randomize, clone, reset, deterministic signing consistency
- `fuzz_hash`: HMAC/RFC6979 chunking consistency and finalized-state cleanup
- `fuzz_scalar`: scalar rounded multiply-shift boundaries against an independent product
- `fuzz_field`: internal field normalization, arithmetic, encoding, add-int boundaries, and maximum-magnitude consistency
- `fuzz_group`: Jacobian/affine group-operation agreement, batch conversion, and state cleanup
- `fuzz_ecmult_const`: constant-time multiplication against scalar-derived points
- `fuzz_ecmult_multi`: internal scratch/no-scratch multi multiplication consistency
- `fuzz_ecdh`: ECDH symmetry with default and coordinate passthrough hashers
- `fuzz_ellswift`: EllSwift encode/decode, XDH symmetry, built-in hash cleanup
- `fuzz_xonly_tweak`: x-only serialization, parity, tweak, keypair equivalence, invalid keypair extraction, invalid comparator ordering
- `fuzz_recovery`: recoverable ECDSA round trips when recovery is enabled
- `fuzz_schnorrsig`: Schnorr sign/verify and `sign32`/`sign_custom` equivalence
- `fuzz_musig`: MuSig key aggregation, tweak equivalence, x-only-tweak signing, nonce/signature round trips

When a target fails, replay the generated input against this branch and clean
`master`, then classify the finding as a production bug, stale oracle, invalid
domain construction, sanitizer-only issue, or already-covered behavior.

## Current-Master Finding Ledger

The following severities describe the exact `origin/master` audit baseline
(`ebf5943` when recorded), before the corresponding branch fixes. A later
minor fix must not be allowed to hide a more serious master failure. Every
production finding has a focused corpus and a mutation or deterministic proof
documented in its commit message.

- **Low / informational:** `ecmult_multi/scratch-wrap-create` (`b827e0e`). The
  internal scratch constructor can wrap `base_alloc + size` before allocation,
  but caller-reachability is limited to static test, benchmark, and fuzz
  helpers: the public `secp256k1_scratch_space_create` symbols were removed and
  production MuSig aggregation currently uses the no-scratch path. The guard is
  still useful internal robustness and future-proofing, but this is not a
  remotely reachable or exported production memory-corruption primitive. The
  original commit's High label is superseded by this clean-master reachability
  audit.
- **Medium:** invalid and noncanonical opaque public-key state
  (`5ad8052`, `334bae0`, `2b7a931`), inconsistent opaque keypairs used for
  signing or nonce creation (`9e70605`), and opaque ECDSA and recoverable
  signature scalars/metadata (`786bd4b`, `6c8a008`). These require malformed
  local opaque state or an invalid direct API call; they are not wire-format
  remote attacks, but they can otherwise let invalid objects cross a signing,
  verification, serialization, or recovery boundary.
- **Medium:** MuSig opaque state semantics: invalid aggregate-cache points
  (`cefe4c8`), cache parity/tweak normalization (`9484be8`), nonce points and
  secret nonce scalars (`2b2c15d`), session parity/nonce/scalar fields
  (`1a5f517`), and overflowing partial-signature scalars (`0863a8b`). These
  magic-preserving mutations can alter signing state or make verification
  builds and release builds disagree; each has a focused mutation or corpus
  proof. X-only odd-Y state (`f812b84`) is the corresponding extrakeys parity
  barrier.
- **Medium:** direct NULL dereferences in exported built-in nonce callbacks
  (`ab0cb33`), ECDH/EllSwift hash callbacks (`35ffb87`), and missing prefix
  data in the EllSwift built-in XDH callback (`067d4a3`). Clean master can
  dereference required callback input before returning ordinary failure.
  Direct RFC6979 callback attempts at `UINT_MAX` (`e862628`) are a separate
  availability bug: the unsigned retry loop can wrap and hang. These are
  public callback/API misuse paths, not wire-format attacks.
- **Medium:** HMAC/RFC6979 secret-state retention after finalization
  (`5cfe7f7`). This is a lifetime/cleanup finding rather than a demonstrated
  disclosure; severity must not be raised to critical without a memory-read
  primitive.
- **Medium:** malformed long-form lengths in
  `contrib/lax_der_privatekey_parsing` (`d334351`). Clean master forms an
  out-of-range pointer while evaluating a short caller buffer before rejecting
  the claimed length. This is parser-level undefined behavior in a
  caller-reachable contribution, distinct from the core DER signature parser.
- **Low:** core ECDSA DER input-length pointer construction (`cd8c9f1`). On
  clean master, a direct `secp256k1_ecdsa_signature_parse_der` call with a
  one-byte non-DER buffer and `SIZE_MAX` input length forms `sig + size` before
  rejecting the encoding; UBSan reports pointer overflow. The public API
  requires an array of `inputlen` bytes, so this is not a remote DER or
  cryptographic vulnerability. The offset parser removes the undefined
  behavior while preserving valid DER behavior, and the `fuzz_api_roundtrip`
  regression checks rejection plus cleared output state.
- **Low to Medium:** fixed and variable output state left live after failed API
  calls (`c02dc5e`, `799a080`), including documented invalidation on NULL
  tweaks (`4759bd8`, `f48cd99`). A caller that ignores a failure can
  accidentally reuse a prior key, signature, hash, encoding, or serialized
  prefix. The known output sizes make these paths testable and fail-closed, but
  there is no direct memory corruption and callers are required to check return
  values.
- **Low:** the contrib BER private-key exporter left its documented 279-byte
  output buffer unchanged when an invalid secret key made export fail
  (`36a009f`). Clean master still reset the output length to zero, so callers
  that ignored the return value could retain stale private-key encoding bytes;
  this was stale state rather than a cryptographic failure or memory-safety
  issue. The deterministic `ecdsa` regression and the dedicated
  `privkey-der-export-failure` corpus seed prove the failure for both encoding
  modes and preserve the boundary between the cleared 279 bytes and the rest
  of the caller's buffer.
- **Low to Medium:** secret-derived stack/helper temporaries left live after use
  (`a3e30b3`, `a6f0b14`, `f94fec5`, `a884a2d`). These are code-path-proven
  lifetime reductions for scalar, field, Jacobian, EllSwift, and tweak state;
  no read primitive is demonstrated. They are more relevant than public
  nonce-buffer cleanup, but should not be described as critical erasure without
  a memory-disclosure path.
- **Low:** impossible SHA256 lengths (`ab36b78`), scalar rounded-shift
  bounds (`422bab2`), EllSwift zero-`u` normalization (`119b407`), built-in
  ECDH failure-output cleanup (`bb15eb0`), NULL preallocated context
  storage (`a9253c2`), and partial `ecmult_multi` results after a later batch
  fails (`5bd9ae8`). The latter is an internal helper boundary: callers must
  honor the failure return, so it is state hygiene rather than a remotely
  reachable cryptographic defect.
- **Low:** noncanonical MuSig nonce storage (`64250f7`) and overflowing opaque
  partial-signature serialization (`3c1d67b`) are local API-consistency and
  cross-build robustness failures. MuSig failed parse/aggregation/session and
  nonce-output cleanup (`5da4893`, `dd7030b`, `28c308d`, `50bb71f`, `ea0fff3`,
  `73de850`, `8780cdc`, `a8457e2`) is stale-state hygiene; public nonce cleanup
  remains non-critical when the nonce has no cryptographic meaning.
- **Low / informational hardening:** zero MuSig nonce scalars (`5b7ae25`) are
  cryptographically meaningful invalid state but require an approximately
  2^-255 reduced-model relation under the real order; infinity key aggregates
  (`ee7f44c`) likewise require an infeasible hash relation on normal master.
  Their reduced-order/exhaustive mutations prove the contracts without claiming
  a practical remote vulnerability.
- **Informational oracle gaps:** EllSwift decode/XDH postconditions (`792f43f`),
  empty public-key aggregation (`c5c0afe`), ECDSA verification's invalid-
  opaque-key API boundary (`ef25d27`), and the public-key serializer's wrong
  flag-type boundary currently pass on master; their mutations prove that the
  harness would catch a regression, not that master is presently vulnerable.
  The context target also forces a multi-block custom SHA callback batch
  (`sha256-multiblock`): master passes the independent digest check, while a
  one-block production mutation aborts before it can hide a batching error.
  The field target also pins the largest valid `secp256k1_fe_add_int` input:
  magnitude 31 plus `0x7fff` must normalize identically to a low-magnitude
  reference. The production wrapper now asserts this precondition before the
  magnitude can exceed the documented 32 limit. Clean master passed the valid
  boundary; the invalid magnitude-32 call is a caller-domain violation, not a
  current production finding.
  The Schnorr target also checks that custom nonce callbacks receive the
  normalized secret key and matching x-only public key. A mutation that passes
  the secret-key buffer in place of the x-only key still produces signatures
  accepted by ordinary verification, so this callback-domain contract needs
  its own oracle (this commit).
  The MuSig target also completes signing after deterministic x-only tweaks,
  including the zero tweak and both final-key parities. This binds the cache's
  accumulated parity to partial-signature verification and final Schnorr
  verification. Negating the `secp256k1_extrakeys_ge_even_y` condition in
  `secp256k1_musig_pubkey_tweak_add_internal` makes the focused seed abort;
  the existing x-only implementation passes, so this is oracle hardening
  rather than a current-master finding.
  The x-only target also rejects a zeroed opaque keypair at
  `secp256k1_keypair_xonly_pub`, clears the x-only output, and preserves an
  initialized zero optional parity result. This is an informational local-state
  oracle: clean master already rejects the object, while skipping the
  `secp256k1_keypair_load` result check makes the focused seed abort.
  It also checks that `secp256k1_xonly_pubkey_cmp` maps an invalid opaque
  x-only key to the documented all-zero ordering sentinel: invalid is below a
  valid key, the reverse comparison is above, and two invalid keys compare
  equal. Clean master already has this behavior; changing the comparator's
  invalid-key fallback makes the focused seed abort.
  The group target also compares the constant-time and variable-time batch
  Jacobian-to-affine conversions on finite points. Clean master already agrees
  on this internal representation contract; changing the constant-time
  prefix-product initialization makes the focused seed abort. Infinity points
  remain in the variable-time-only path because the constant-time helper's
  caller contract requires finite inputs.

If a clean-master replay stops at an earlier known failure, isolate the later
contract with its dedicated seed or a minimal production mutation. Do not
claim the later behavior was tested merely because a follow-up fix lets the
full harness continue.

## l0rinc Fork Duplicate Audit

The l0rinc remote and all pull-request heads were refreshed against the same
`origin/master` baseline (`ebf594320dc838b9de1abb54d5ba98cef84f4297`) on
2026-07-12. The exact head mapping below is a replay ledger, not a claim that
the hashes must be ancestors of this branch: equivalent fixes were often
cherry-picked with new proof, and several heads are optimization stacks.

- PR #1 (`6e60f8d`) and PR #2 (`51e93c4`) repeat the existing MuSig, hash,
  EllSwift, ECDH, callback, opaque-key, scratch-size, and output-cleanup
  findings. The scratch-size guard (`d7e3b49`/`b827e0e`) remains an internal
  robustness fix, not a public High-severity vulnerability, as recorded above.
  The relevant production fixes and fuzzer barriers are already in this
  branch, including `f1e3eba`/`5ad8052`,
  `3618f4e`/`f9f1a6e`, `7075ed0`/`f48cd99`, and the MuSig cleanup series.
- PR #3 (`7ed2abc`) repeats invalid-secret MuSig nonce-output coverage. The
  public nonce has no cryptographic meaning here, so its clearing is Low
  severity stale-state hygiene, not critical secret erasure (`52c573b`).
- PR #4 (`b9a169b`) is an optimization stack, but it is **not behavior-neutral
  on top of this audit branch**. In addition to inlining and hash fast paths,
  it removes HMAC/RFC6979 and EllSwift temporary clearing, restores unchecked
  ECDH public-key loading and built-in failure-output behavior, and drops the
  EllSwift zero-`u` and callback-input guards. Applying it here would revert or
  mask already-rated clean-master findings (`5cfe7f7`, `35ffb87`, `119b407`,
  `067d4a3`, and the cleanup series), so it was deliberately not cherry-picked.
  Its optimizations may only be evaluated after those barriers are reapplied
  and independently replayed. PR #5 (`f06920c`) and PR #6 (`ac915c9`) are
  force-inline/field optimization subsets with no distinct production oracle;
  they must not be treated as proof that the affected master behavior was safe.
- PR #7 (`3f5fafa`) and PR #9 (`3f5fafa`, the same head) contain comments and
  test-maintenance changes. Their BER test encoding and aggregate-nonce
  assertions do not supersede the production findings or their dedicated
  mutations on this branch.
- PR #8 (`248be19`) combines the PR #4 stack with `104f53e` hardening and
  test/tool follow-ups. Its BER test change is covered by `d4d1519`/`0cf6f5d`,
  but the inherited PR #4 behavior changes still conflict with the cleanup and
  failure barriers above. Replaying that stack after the barriers would be a
  separate optimization experiment, not evidence that clean master was safe.
- PR #10 (`65d38b0`) contains two boundary fixes. The `fe_equal` bound change
  is already in master and is retained as regression coverage. The 10x26
  magnitude-32 normalization overflow was a real **Medium** latent
  current-master correctness bug, fixed separately in `cf5631f`, with the
  deterministic boundary proof in `7ef0714` and the fuzzer oracle in
  `139f6ab`. The commit message records why its impact can become High if
  valid maximum-magnitude internal state is reached; the current public
  trigger remains unproven.
- PR #11 (`d1dca5c`) repeats the checked `pubkey_load` return paths already
  covered by `5ad8052`, `f9f1a6e`, and `7767442`.
- PR #12 (`e153e26`) is exactly the behavior-preserving 5x52 word-serialization
  optimization already recorded as `91e4f02`. Its commit intentionally follows
  the master-based findings and states that it is not security evidence.

No new l0rinc commit was cherry-picked in this refresh: every relevant commit
is either already represented with stronger current-master proof, already in
master, or changes performance/comments without adding a contract. This keeps
the discovery order intact. Fork patches are never used to prove that a
current-master failure was absent; every important barrier still has its own
seed or minimal production mutation, and severity is always assigned against
the clean baseline before later fixes are applied.
